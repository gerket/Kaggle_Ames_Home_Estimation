# General Assembly DSI Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

The specific [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-5-project-2-regression-challenge) this project is for was made for the DSI cohort so it may not be open to the public.

[General Assembly Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive)

## Goals:
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model(s)
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process

You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

This project is to practice the following skills:

- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science
